# A collection of Lecture Notes
These are scanned copies of my handwritten lecture notes from my classes here at IISER Kolkata. I try to keep them updated and complete (and accurate).

Currently, it only has material from my 4th and 6th Semester. I plan on digging up my older notes and uploading them later.

Hope this is of some use to you. Cheers!

P.S. - If you find any mistakes or missing material, please feel free to contact me.
